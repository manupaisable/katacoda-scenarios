In a short sequence of steps, we have built and launched a simple but complete delivery system. 

All the necessary configuration was coded, allowing a full restore of Jenkins, including required plugins and job for our application. 

Once Jenkins found the application pipeline definition (Jenkinsfile) in its repo, it launched the pipeline run without any manual intervention.

In short, with "everything as code" and a few commands we have been able to go from nothing running to a full delivery system with pipelines being executed!
