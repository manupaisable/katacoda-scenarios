We want to quickly bootstrap a new pipeline for our new (forked) app.

We can do this with a simple script that creates a new pipeline job from an existing one:

``./pipeline-add-new-from-existing.sh todobackend-java my-todobackend https://github.com/username/spincast-todobackend.git``

**Note**: you need to copy/paste the command and replace "*username*" by your actual GitHub username. 

You can see what the script does in the editor frame here to the right by clicking *pipeline-add-new-from-existing.sh*.
