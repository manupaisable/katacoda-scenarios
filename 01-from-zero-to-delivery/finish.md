In a short sequence of steps, we have built and launched a simple but complete delivery system. 

All the necessary configuration was coded, allowing a full restore of Jenkins, including required plugins and jobs for our application. 

Once Jenkins found the application pipeline definition (Jenkinsfile) in its repo, it launched the pipeline run without any manual intervention.

In short, we have been able to go from nothing running to a full delivery system with pipelines being executed!
